# My stanCode Projects (Python, C++, JAVA)

- I started to learn Python with "stanCode" courses.
- I had finished courses "SC001", "SC101" in 2023, and finished courses "SC201" in 2024.
  - SC001: Basics of Python, include deciphering, Hangman game, and so on.
  - SC101: Advances of Python, include object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithm.
  - SC201: AI courses, include machine learning & neural network, and so on.
  
- Here are the programs that I accomplished during stanCode courses! (Updating...to be continued...)
